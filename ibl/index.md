This lesson provides an opportunity to see what simple spelling issues can do when running Python code. This website has an embedded Python script runner for running basic Python code. Please use the Python script runner to address two problems that have been introduced in the code.

This Python script provided in the left-hand box converts speed from KM/H to MPH, which may be handy for calculating speed limits when driving abroad, especially for UK and US drivers. 

Note: The conversion formula for kph to mph is : 1 kilometre = 0.621371192 miles

## Exercise 1
* Run the code as presented
  1. Click the play <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale,w_168,f_auto,q_auto/v1507227463/play-pause-in-css_5_eqomuf.png" width="12" height="12" /> button in the script runner.
  2. Click your mouse next to the text "Enter km/h" in the right-hand box of the script runner and type in 50.
  3. Press enter on your keyboard. (Note the error message)

## Exercise 2
* Try to fix the code
  1. Correct the variable name issue in the code [Hover your mouse here for a hint](HINT "The variable milesperhour is missing an h in line 3")
  2. Click the play <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale,w_168,f_auto,q_auto/v1507227463/play-pause-in-css_5_eqomuf.png" width="12" height="12" /> button in the script runner.
  2. Click your mouse next to the text "Enter km/h" in the right-hand box of the script runner and type in 50.
  3. Press enter on your keyboard. (Is there anything else to fix?) [Hover your mouse here for a hint](HINT "The word speed is misspelled")
  
### Reflection

In exercise 1, you were introduced to an error that prevented the Python script from running and in exercise 2 you had hints to allow you to fix the code. These two misspelled words caused different issues. The word speed in the example Python script acts as a label that is printed to the screen in the Python print command. However, the word milesperhour is a variable name. When the variable name is misspelled in exercise 1 it causes the entire program to not function. 
 
Take a moment to change the code further such as changing the abbreviated variable name kmh to kilometersperhour or cat in line 1 and 3 to see what happens.

### Please
Once you have completed the lesson please reset the code back to have the word speed spelled sped in line 3 and the variable milesperhour spelled milesperour in line 3 for the next participant.
