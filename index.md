This lesson provides an opportunity to see what simple spelling issues can do when running Python code. This website has an embedded Python script runner for running basic Python code. Please use the Python script runner to address two problems that have been introduced in the code.

This Python script provide in the left-hand box converts speed from KM/H to MPH, which may be handy for calculating speed limits when driving abroad, especially for UK and US drivers. 

Note: The conversion formula for kph to mph is : 1 kilometre = 0.621371192 miles

## Exercise 1
* Run the code as presented
  1. Click the play <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale,w_168,f_auto,q_auto/v1507227463/play-pause-in-css_5_eqomuf.png" width="12" height="12" /> button in the script runner.
  2. Click your mouse next to the text "Enter km/h" in the right-hand box of the script runner and type in 50.
  3. Press enter on your keyboard. (Note the error message)

## Exercise 2
* Try to fix the code
  1. Correct the variable name issue in the code [Hover your mouse here for a hint](HINT "The variable milesperhour is missing an h in line 3")
  2. Click the play <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale,w_168,f_auto,q_auto/v1507227463/play-pause-in-css_5_eqomuf.png" width="12" height="12" /> button in the script runner.
  2. Click your mouse next to the text "Enter km/h" in the right-hand box of the script runner and type in 50.
  3. Press enter on your keyboard. (Is there anything else to fix?) [Hover your mouse here for a hint](HINT "The word speed is misspelled")
