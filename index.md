# What's wrong with the code?

This lesson provides an oppurtunity to test your Python coding knowledge. This website has an embedded Python script runner for running basic Python code. Please use the Python script runner to address two problems that have been introduced in the code.

This Python script in the left hand box converts speed from KM/H to MPH, which may be handy for calculating speed limits when driving abroad, especially for UK and US drivers. 

Note: The conversion formula for kph to mph is : 1 kilometre = 0.621371192 miles

## Exercise 1
* Run the code as presented
  1. Click the <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale,w_168,f_auto,q_auto/v1507227463/play-pause-in-css_5_eqomuf.png" width="12" height="12" /> play button in the script runner.
  2. Place your mouse cursor in the right box of the script runner and type in 50.
  3. Press enter on your keyboard. (Note the error message)

## Exercise 2
* Try to fix the code
  1. Correct the variable name issue in the code [Hover your mouse here for a hint](HINT "The variable milesperhour is missing an h in line 3")
  2. Click the <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/upload/c_scale,w_168,f_auto,q_auto/v1507227463/play-pause-in-css_5_eqomuf.png" width="12" height="12" /> play button in the script runner.
  2. Place your mouse cursor in the right box of the script runner and type in 50.
  3. Press enter on your keyboard. (Is there anything else to fix?)
